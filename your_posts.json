But it's a step in the right direction(in comparison to last season); it's great that they found a way to close the game out somehow/someway... I'll take it(pretty sure u will too LOL). However, that D isn't gonna be able to sustain that tenacity & consistency; they're gonna get fatigued @ some point. Trubisky is gonna have to figure IT out ASAP; at least improve that spotty accuracy of his. I'm a bit skeptical on him as a \"future star\" @ the QB position. I know he's inexperienced and lacks the adequate NFL playing time atm, but I honestly would trust a peak Jay Cutler's progressions(reads/decision making) for this team RIGHT NOW. Am I exaggerating Mr. C; wby, what's your take on the circumstances?! \n\nHOWEVER, considering the past, recent misery we've had to endure; being the last few mediocre seasons. I'll openly admit that I'm content regardless LOL(bc \"2-1\" is most def better/more ideal than the alternative of: \"1-2\", \"0-3\", or any ties in our last column) \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082."
